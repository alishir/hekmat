There are so many collections of sermons, orations, epistles and aphorisms, sayings, and Teachings of ʿAlī ibn Abi Talib, son-in-law of Prophet Muhammad and the first Imam of Shi'a Islam, the most notables are:

- Nahj al-balaghah (The Path of Eloquence), collected by al-Sharif al-Radi (d. 406/1015)

- Miʾat kalimah (One Hundred Proverbs), attributed to the eminent Abbasid litterateur, al-Jāḥiẓ (d. 255/869). 

- Dustur ma'alim al-hikam wa ma 'thur makarim al-shiyam min kalam amir al-mu 'minin 'Ali ibn Abi Talib (Collected Aphorisms and Noble Sayings of the Commander of the Faithful 'Ali ibn Abi Talib), collected by Al-Qāḍī al-Qudaʿī (d. 454/1062)

- Ghurar al-hikam wa durar al-kalim (Blazes of Wisdom and Pearls of Oratory), collected by Taj al-Din 'Abd al-Wahid ibn Muhammad al-Tamimi al-Amidi (sixth century)

But today, after the big disruption of online communication and the emergence of cloud services, there was a need for a new user-friendly and easy-to-use collection of those sayings, so we created this online social collection for every lover of Imam Ali as to search, read, bookmark and share his favorite sayings with others.

We hope you find this new tool useful, and let us know your feedback and suggestions.
